            <p>Welcome to the World of Indigo! Get ready to for an enlightening journey as I
                explore the History of Indigo, its intricate relationship with Slave Trade and
                Amsterdam, its Mystical and Sacred powers, and how it has been utilized in Artistic
                Practice. We'll also delve into Amsterdam's role as the Denim Capital of the World
                and how this has influenced Artists and Designers in the City. This Blog is based
                on Books, Online Articles and an Archival Visit, so fasten your seatbelts! From a
                Wednesday Special with John Gage discussing a Pop of Blue in the Cultural Scene to
                DIY Sundays with Indigo Witchcraft, we'll be uncovering all things blue. And don't
                forget about Herman Pleij's interpretation of Blue that is taking the Fashion World
                by Storm, it’s dangerously stylish! I will also spill some tea on the Current Use
                of Indigo, Innovation and Fashion Tech. So join me on this captivating voyage into
                Indigo, you won't regret it!

            <h1>The History of Indigo, focusing on its relation to slave trade and Amsterdam </h1>
            <p style="font-family: 'ABC Diatype Semi-Mono Condensed Light Unlicensed Trial';">Blog 2, February 2023</p>
            <p>This thesis explores the history and mystical powers of indigo, focusing on its relation to the slave
                trade and Amsterdam. It tells this story by looking at artistic practices, with a focus on artist
                Antonio José Guzmán and artist and designer Iva Jankovic, as well as the British artist group Singh
                Twins and De Stijl. The use of indigo dye and natural pigments in artistic practice is discussed,
                including the works of Rijn Kooyman, Job Wouters and Dutch painters. Amsterdam is then explored as the
                denim capital of the world, discussing trendsetting with denim, daring starts, innovative ventures and
                Amsterdam Denim Days. It also mentiones a big list of Amsterdam-based denim specialists with for
                instance Studio Sophie Hardeman, Nudie Jeans repair shop and Amsterdams Blauw. Finally, this thesis
                discusses the current use and future of indigo. My thesis is written using archival visits, books and
                articles. By gaining a better understanding of the sustainable fashion scene in Amsterdam, my ambitions
                as a graphic designer, that wishes to work in fashion, will be strengthened and my positioning improved.
