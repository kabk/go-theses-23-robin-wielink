					<p style="color:#aac2fa;">
					<p style="color:#aac2fa;">This thesis explores Amsterdam as a denim capital and color (with a
						focus on indigo), from commercial applications to independent expression
						with artistic analysis and psychological and philosophical perspectives.
						It is also a metaphorical quest on the shades that we wear as a mask to
						present ourselves to the world - do we show our true colors, or do we
						conceal us behind a facade? What shade do you put forward and when? What
						does your gradient consist of? Michael Taussig suggests in <em>What
							Colour Is The Sacred</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> that color can signify authenticity
						or character and we can see it as something alive, with which I
						agree.</p>
					<p style="color:#aac2fa;">From personal experience, I have learned that the way we present
						ourselves can be a powerful tool in navigating difficult situations.
						Simon O'Sullivan's concept of affect as a transhuman aesthetic furthers
						this idea by suggesting that our matter resonates with the matter around
						us and allows us to connect with the world.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
						Jean-Paul Sartre's quote <em>"In life man commits himself and draws his
							own portrait, outside of which there is nothing”</em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
							id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
						emphasizes how important it is for us to take control over our lives and
						create our own destiny. As an artist, I believe these ideas are
						essential in understanding how we can use fashion and aesthetics as a
						means of self-expression and empowerment.</p>

						are all hex codes of shades indigo that have been used in the
						dyeing of clothing around the world. I want to emphasize that I am using
						these shades of indigo and denim as metaphorical representations on the
						intensity of observation and being, not as literal interpretations and
						uses of their hues. These shades embody something becoming deeper and
						more intense each step and can be seen as a journey. In my afterword
						(#182a50), I will discuss how my thesis came into being and my
						motivation.

					<p style="color: #4176e1;font-size:1.2rem;"><b>#4176e1</b>
					<p style="color: #4176e1;"> Amsterdam is known for being a hub for the denim industry with a high
						concentration of denim designers, offices and stores in the city.<a href="#fn6"
							class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> It is estimated that
						the denim
						cluster in Amsterdam is worth €500 million. Amsterdam is considered one
						of the leading denim capitals in the world alongside Los Angeles and
						Tokyo.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>
						Amsterdam has set a trend in the
						denim industry by promoting sustainability, collaboration and education.
						The city is home to a number of well-known denim labels such as
						<em>G-Star</em>, <em>Levi's</em> Made <em>&amp; Crafted</em>, and
						<em>Denham the Jeanmaker</em>, but also a Jean School (with an actual 3
						year bachelor program). The growth in the denim industry can be
						attributed to the favourable Dutch tax system, a high number of art
						academies, and the <em>‘down-to-earth’</em> mentality of the Dutch which
						is reflected in their casual style.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>
					</p>

					<img src="assets/images/foto-1.png" alt="thesis-1" width="100%" />

					<p style="color: #4176e1;">Adriano Goldschmied, the
						co-founder of the Italian denim label <em>Diesel</em> explains the
						special connection between the Netherlands and denim, calling Amsterdam
						a "global village" that attracts international professionals from all
						over the world.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> The Netherlands is a jeans-savvy
						country, with 20 million pairs of jeans sold each year, but the
						production process for denim is environmentally harmful and requires a
						large amount of water.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
						To address these concerns, a number of Amsterdam-based brands have
						signed an agreement known as ‘A Denim Deal’, committing to using a
						minimum of 5% recycled content in every pair of jeans and creating at
						least one million jeans with 20% post-consumer recycled content.<a href="#fn13"
							class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
					<p style="color: #4176e1;">Stakeholders in the Amsterdam denim scene are working to make
						circular denim a mainstream product and the city is aiming to be fully
						circular by 2050. Former Minister Stientje van Veldhoven spoke at a
						press conference acknowledging the difficulties faced by fashion firms
						in making changes, but expressing her hope that the Denim Deal would
						become a worldwide initiative soon.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Once a year there is
						also a major denim event in Amsterdam. For six days, the city hosts a
						public program with presentations of new products at the
						Westergasfabriek. This Dutch initiative was also launched in New York in
						2017 as New York Denim Days.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"

					<p style="color: #8672ef; font-size:1.2rem;"><b>#8672ef</b>

					<p style="color: #8672ef;">Koen Tossijn was at first solely focused on bespoke denim with his
						label <em>Atelier Tossijn</em>, but he always had ambitions to create a
						full wardrobe of staple pieces.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Recently, Koen has
						been on a quest to find a way to make his work stand out while still
						working within the modern-day fashion industry.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>
						He created an alternative for the high tempo of production, information
						and stress that is so common today in fashion.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

					<p style="color: #8672ef;">Koen's <em>Wardrobe</em>
						collection consists of four immaculate pieces made from only the best
						materials available.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> His denim is created in-house with
						a single thread machine and hand-stitching details out of 10 oz yarn
						indigo-dyed selvage twill fabric made of US cotton and woven at the
						Kuroki mill in Japan.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> The industrial jacket that he makes
						is also created in-house with a single thread machine and hand-stitching
						details out of the same fabric.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> The sweater in his
						collection is made from dark, nearly black, blue merino wool from Loro
						Piana (knitted in Italy), while the flat hat is constructed from dark,
						nearly black, blue wool cashmere and is made in England by James Lock
						&amp; Co.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>
					</p>

					<p style="color: #8672ef;">Koen's view on fashion is one
						that focuses on quality over quantity; he believes that by bringing
						things back to their most essential form we can create more time and
						space for ourselves, as well as offer an alternative for those who want
						something different than what traditional fashion offers them.<a href="#fn23"
							class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> Since there is no
						distraction from
						the self, his minimalistic collection can be seen as a maskless canvas.
						This reminds me of the vision of <em>Bonne Suits</em>, where I conducted
						an internship.</p>


					<img src="assets/images/foto-2-2.png" alt="thesis-1" width="100%" />

					<p style="color: #8672ef;">Mick Keus is the founder of his studio <em>MICKKEUS</em>. Mick’s
						original take on denim is a unique blend of vintage and modern.<a href="#fn24"
							class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> His designs are
						inspired by the
						classic Levi’s 501 jeans with a contemporary twist. He uses high-quality
						materials to create custom-made pieces that are both stylish and
						durable. The process begins with Mick selecting the perfect pair of
						jeans. He then customizes these by cutting and sewing the fabric where
						it should be adjusted and tailored.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> In an interview with
						<em>Metro</em><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>, Mick expressed his preference for
						the older fabrics of the 501s, saying that they "represent the real
						rock-n-roll style and age beautifully."<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>
					</p>
					<p style="color: #8672ef;">Keus' approach to sustainability is not something he consciously
						strives for; however, by using secondhand materials he is still being
						sustainable without having to boast about it.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
						He believes that by creating one-of-a-kind pieces from preloved
						materials, customers can enjoy a unique look while also reducing their
						environmental impact.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> Furthermore, Keus has stated in an
						interview with <em>One World</em> that aesthetics are more important
						than sustainability to him.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> However, this does not
						mean that sustainability should be overlooked or disregarded entirely.
						Instead, it should be seen as a bonus.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

					<img src="assets/images/river-4.png" alt="thesis-1" width="100%" />

					<p style="color: #8672ef;">Fashion photographer Rein Kooyman's use of natural pigments in his
						work is a testament to his deep-rooted fascination for nature and the
						power of stillness.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> I see a relation here with the
						calming and divine power of blue and the revealing power of purple and
						this could be a reason Kooyman uses both colors often. John Gage
						describes blue as the color of divine light and purple the color of
						divine darkness<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>. In Kooyman’s photo series <em>This
							Too Shall Pass</em> he used natural pigments, clay, herbal powders, fine
						crushed stones, Arabic gum and water from the Veneon river in the South
						of France to paint giant boulders.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
					<p style="color: #8672ef;">Kooyman believes that every color he uses is a symbol of a specific
						period in his life; as the colors fade with time—so does the moment.<a href="#fn35"
							class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> He is an expert in
						creating systems
						that produce natural shades. He sees this process as profoundly
						peaceful; it allows him time to reflect on his unconditional love for
						nature and city life. Through this project Kooyman hopes to remind
						people to consciously practice the art of being in the moment.</p>
					<p style="color: #8672ef;">The painting sessions are often done alone, allowing Kooyman time for
						self-reflection and contemplation while creating something beautiful out
						of nature’s materials.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> The rocks turn back to their
						natural states over time; reminding us that everything passes
						eventually, including our own lives, and we should make sure we
						appreciate each moment while it lasts.</p>

					<p style="color:#9d43f1;"> Electric Dub Station (Orbital Ignition)</em> is a collaboration
						between artist Antonio Jose Guzman and artist and textile designer Iva
						Jankovic, which explores the history of slave trade and indigo through
						artistic practice. The installation consists of performers wearing
						traditional clothing from Surinamese and Javanese plantations,
						accompanied by an audio-visual performance featuring dub music.<a href="#fn37"
							class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> It is intended to
						evoke the memory
						of those who were enslaved in the production of indigo, while also
						highlighting indigo’s importance in contemporary culture.</p>

					<p style="color:#9d43f1;">Through this work, Guzman and Jankovic aim to create a space for
						reflection on our shared history and its implications for today's
						society.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>
						It serves as an invitation to
						explore the past through art, music and movement. It is an opportunity
						to reflect on how our present is shaped by our collective histories,
						while also providing a platform for dialogue about how we can move
						forward together in creating a better future. By bringing together
						elements from different cultures and contexts, Guzman and Jankovic
						create a powerful visual representation of the history of slave trade
						that speaks to contemporary audiences. Through their work they hope to
						inspire viewers to think critically about their own relationship with
						history, identity and power dynamics to create meaningful change in
						their communities.</p>

					<p style="color:#9d43f1;">The artwork <em>Jallianwala: Repression and Retribution (Indigo: The
							Colour of India),</em> by the British artist duo Singh Twins, explores
						stories around the dye extracted from the leaves of the indigo plant.<a href="#fn39"
							class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> Indigo dye and
						textiles became
						highly desired across the globe, from the Far East and Africa to Europe,
						North America, and the West Indies. Determined to have control of the
						market, knowledge about how to cultivate indigo was eagerly sought by
						European traders.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

					<p style="color:#9d43f1;">This artwork depicts the 17th-century Indian queen, Mumtaz Mahal, the
						wife of Emperor Shah Jahan (depicted in her pendant) who placed the
						monopoly on the trade of indigo.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> She wears blue denim
						jeans commonly associated with modern western fashion and values. She
						thereby presents a challenge to this perception regarding the cultural
						ownership of denim fabric, because she says the true origins go back to
						16th century India, in the port town of Dongri, where this tough fabric
						was used for sails and <em>‘dungri’</em> (later ‘dungarees’) worn by
						sailors.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a>
					</p>


					<img src="assets/images/foto-4.png" alt="thesis-1" width="100%" />

					<p style="color:#9d43f1;">Through wearing many jewels, Mumtaz additionally represents the fact
						that Indigo dye was once rare and very expensive, a luxury commodity
						associated with royalty, political power and authority.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref"
							id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a>
						Otherwise known as the ‘blue gold’, Indigo was so valuable that when
						prices were high, it was used as currency to purchase slaves who were
						worth their own weight in indigo. During the 16th and 17th centuries,
						England and Europe passed laws banning the trade and use of Indian
						Indigo because it threatened to replace their home-grown blue dye (woad)
						industry. In the West, people were also scared of the color because they
						believed it had mystical powers.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> To discourage its
						popularity, it was officially condemned as <em>“the false and pernicious
							Indian drug”, “poisonous”, “deceitful and injurious”, “the devil’s
							blue”</em> and <em>“food for the devil”!</em><a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref"
							id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
					<p style="color:#9d43f1;">Pictured bottom right is the Portuguese explorer Vasco Da Gama who is
						credited as the first European to discover the sea route to India in
						1498. Although he was guided there, the artist claims, from Malindi on
						the West coast of Africa by an Indian navigator from Gujarat.
						Nevertheless, this event is hugely significant to the story of indigo,
						because it enabled European merchants to trade directly with India
						rather than relying on middlemen in the traditional marts of the Levant
						(Eastern Mediterranean region).<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"

					<p style="color:#7c33cf; font-size:1.2rem;"><B>#7c33cf</B></p>

					<p style="color:#7c33cf;">In Herman Pleij's book <em>Colors Demonic and Divine: Shades of
							Meaning in the Middle Ages And After</em>, he talks about how blue is
						used to represent a wide range of negative qualities from the Middle
						Ages onwards. These negative connotations to the color must be related
						to the equally extreme positive points that the color offers. The more
						heavenly and timeless the associations with blue are the sharper must
						also be the earthly opposites. Pleij describes how blue represented
						heaven and visualizes the bridge between earth and hereafter. Therefore
						the Virgin Mary, the mediator between sinful man and God, is always
						clothed in a blue mantle, with loyalty as its keyword.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref"
							id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>
						But the earthly opposite of blue is the fleeting world of appearance,
						deception, and hypocrisy. This finds its expression in an incredible
						number of expressions, sayings and phenomena that still live on today
						for a large part.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

					<p style="color:#7c33cf;">In the Middle Ages, blue became the color of mundane things in life
						that had no place in everyday life.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> Peij describes
						examples such as drunken nobility, corrupt monks, lustful nuns, rich
						sons wasting money on gambling, willing housewives, disabled people and
						other ‘unproductive members of society’. <em>‘Blue beguines’</em> were
						prostitutes (<em>‘Blauwe Bet’</em> for instance was a prostitute from
						Arnhem in 1455), blue devotion was quasi-piety, a man who had been
						cheated on by his wife would be given a blue cloak and a swindler's
						income would be collected in a <em>‘blue pocket’</em>
						(<em>‘aftroggelzak’</em> in Dutch).</p>



					<p style="color:#7c33cf;">These are just examples of the countless applications that still
						exist today in expressions such as <em>‘a blue Monday’</em>,
						<em>‘getting the blues’</em> or <em>‘een blauwtje lopen’</em> (which
						means being rejected in Dutch).<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> It is curious to see
						how inventively, if not literarily, these attractive uses are continued.
						Now we get sayings like <em>‘living in the blue bellows’</em>, meaning
						settling somewhere where one wishes to remain completely unknown.<a href="#fn51"
							class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> There is, I think, a
						lot of pain
						involved in having <em>‘blue balls’</em> and the disqualification
						<em>‘blue-faced’</em> or <em>‘blue shooter’</em> used to be an
						attractive insult for an impotent or failing lover who can no longer
						meet the stereotypical eagerness of a woman.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>
						It is interesting to think that once upon a time it was said in Holland
						that indigo, due to its magical powers and ability to change color when
						exposed to air, could make men infertile.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a>
					</p>

					<img src="assets/images/foto-8.png" alt="thesis-1" width="100%" />

					<p style="color:#7c33cf;">Pleij's description of the Middle Ages paints a picture of a time
						where blue things were not accepted or celebrated due to their
						association with poverty and low social status. This sentiment still
						exists today in the form of inequality and suppression, where certain
						groups are not given the same opportunities or rights as others. I am
						inspired by fashion designers that combat this, like Sophie Hardeman<a href="#fn54"
							class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a> and Ninamounah<a
							href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a>.
						They both create (denim) designs that emphasize the importance of
						standing up against oppression and celebrate individuality. By using
						fashion as armour, they are encouraging people to express themselves
						freely without fear of judgement or discrimination. They believe that
						everyone should be able to wear whatever they want without worrying
						about being judged for their choices. Through their designs, they hope
						to empower people to embrace their uniqueness and stand up for what is
						right despite any opposition they may face, something that was
						unimaginable to think of during Medieval times.</p>
					<p style="color:#7c33cf;">A movement that certainly showed their true colours and were in
						control of the uniqueness of their masks were the <em>Provo’s</em> in
						Amsterdam. This movement (that was active between ’65-’67) was a major
						force in the city's cultural and political landscape, and its legacy can
						be seen in the city's vibrant art scene, progressive politics and
						open-minded attitude.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a> <em>Provo's</em> '<em>ludiek'</em>
						activism was particularly influential; their creative protests and
						stunts were designed to draw attention to social issues such as poverty,
						pollution, police brutality and censorship.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
					<p style="color:#7c33cf;">These tactics were adopted by other activist groups in Amsterdam and
						beyond, inspiring generations of activists to come.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref"
							id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a>
						<em>Provo</em> also had a lasting impact on fashion: their iconic
						anti-materialistic old jeans became a symbol of rebellion for many young
						people in the Netherlands. To this day, denim remains popular among
						Dutch youth as a way to express their individuality and independence.
						This so-claimed <em>‘Free Spirit Of Amsterdam’</em> has inspired it’s
						fashion designers since, with some brands (Scotch &amp; Soda) even using
						it in their taglines.

					<p style="color:#4d2891"> The history of indigo is complex because the color has had such a big
						impact on many cultures around the world. As mentioned before in my
						analysis of <em>Electric Dub Station (Orbital Ignition)</em> and
						<em>Jallianwala: Repression and Retribution</em>, one of the most
						significant periods in the history of indigo is its relationship to
						slave trade, where the Dutch and the City of Amsterdam took a great part

							role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a>
					</p>

					<p style="color:#4d2891"> With the start of the slave trade, indigo began to have a major impact on

						harvested by African slaves.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a> The first clothing

					</p>

					<img src="assets/images/foto-4d.png" alt="thesis-1" width="100%" />

					<p style="color:#4d2891">The city of Amsterdam played an important role in the trade as one of
						leading centers for Dutch slave traders who transported slaves from
						Africa to America, as well as merchants dealing with the sale of indigo
						and other goods produced on the plantations.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a>
						Amsterdam traded with many parts around world contributing significantly

					<p style="color:#4d2891">The Dutch were not the only Europeans involved in the slave trade and

					<p style="color:#4b2974">Indigo has been a timeless symbol of wisdom, self-mastery, and

						has been used to represent a range of themes from transformation to
						power. In Marina Warner's <em>Indigo</em>, the transformative powers of
						Sycorax (Shakespeare's dark witch and a denomized female indigo dyer,
						who tells living memories and story-telling through her craft) serve as
						a powerful metaphor for her spiritual elevation and mastery of self.<a href="#fn70"
							class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a> It suggests that with
						enough
						determination and effort, one can reach a higher level of understanding
						and enlightenment trough making.</p>
					<p style="color:#4b2974">Similarly, in the movie <em>Prospero's Books</em> the water and its
						indigo hue represent postmodern narrative techniques as well as
						political power, communication through books, stages and films, words
						and images, iconic and symbolic signs.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a>
						Indigo is used to illustrate how Prospero's knowledge is both powerful
						yet fragile and can be used to manipulate or enlighten those around him,
						but also be taken away if he fails to use it wisely.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref"
							id="fnref72" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a>
						The use of indigo in this film serves as a reminder that knowledge
						should be respected but also wielded carefully in order to achieve true
						wisdom.</p>
					<p style="color:#4b2974">John Gage's seminal work <em>Color and Culture: Practice and Meaning
							from Antiquity to Abstraction</em> begins by examining the ancient
						Egyptians' utilization of blue in their art and architecture, noting
						that it was seen as a symbol of life, fertility and rebirth due to its
						association with the Nile River.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a> He then delves into
						the use of blue in decorative art such as Islamic tilework, ceramics and
						textiles during the Middle Ages; where it was associated with royalty
						due to its frequent use in tombs and temples dedicated to gods or
						pharaohs.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a>Gage further investigates how perfecting techniques for
						making
						pigments such as cobalt or ultramarine impacted Renaissance art.<a href="#fn75"
							class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
					<p style="color:#4b2974">He also examines how for instance Yves Klein has used monochrome blue
						to evoke strong emotions in viewers and was influenced by modern art
						movements such as De Stijl, who were heavily influenced by
						<em>Neoplasticism</em> - a movement which sought to create a universal
						visual language through simple geometric forms combined with primary
						colors.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76" role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a>
						One of these colors being blue,
						which is often used to represent harmony and balance in this context.<a href="#fn77"
							class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77" role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a>
					</p>

					<img src="assets/images/thesis-4b-2.png" alt="thesis-1" width="100%" />

					<p style="color:#4b2974">Blue is seen as a symbol of the sacred, spiritual purity, truth,
						infinity, order amidst chaos<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a> - all qualities which
						I think are essential for any artist. Michael Taussig's book <em>What
							Colour is the Sacred?</em> gave me an insightful analysis into the
						cultural significance of blue throughout history; from religious
						ceremonies such as Christianity, where it is often used in liturgical
						vestments (see photo example of Virgin Mary in <span
							style="color: #7c33cf"><b>#7c33cf</b></span>). Or Hinduism,
						where it is associated with Krishna. Taussig also discusses blue right
						up until modern times where it can be seen as a unifying force between
						different cultures or religions<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a>.</p>
					<p style="color:#4b2974"><em>“If one of the most sacred aims that man can set for himself is
							to acquire as exact and intense an understanding of himself as possible,
							it seems desirable that each one, scrutinizing his memories with the
							greatest possible honesty, examine whether he can discover there some
							sign permitting him to discern the color for him of the very notion of
							the sacred.”</em><a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a></p>

					<p style="color:#4b2974">In the book <em>I Send You This Cadmium Red,</em> John Berger and
						John Christie share a 15-year dialogue about art, color, life and the
						creative process. Through their intimate letters exchanged between 1977
						to 1992 readers gain a look into the two men's understanding of art, as
						well as their personal reflections on the world around them. But most
						importantly, the book offers a unique perspective on how different
						colors can have symbolic meaning while also exploring the challenges of
						being an artist. They say that color has the power to evoke emotion,
						memory, and nostalgia.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a> It can be a source of comfort or a
						reminder of something lost.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a> In the following
						passages, Berger and Christie explore the nuances of color in a way that
						is both poetic and profound.</p>
					<p style="color:#4b2974">They start with blackness, which is described as <em>“not with the
							color black, but with the mystery, the invitation of black blackness as
							in a black coat, as in black hair”</em>.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a>
						This description paints an image of something dark yet inviting;
						something that holds secrets within its depths, like a mask. I think
						it's interesting that the writer is talking about three seemingly
						unrelated topics - the color black, sex and the forest - and they also
						say that a personal called Bieca's absence is still present. This way of
						looking at these topics reminded me of how precisely these topics were
						treated in David Lynch’s <em>Twin Peaks Series</em>.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref"
							id="fnref84" role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
					<p style="color:#4b2974">The colour black, the forest, sex and a missing girl are all integral
						elements of the series. The
						colour black is used to represent the darkness that lurks beneath the
						surface of this small town, as well as to symbolize death and mystery.
						The forest is a place of secrets and danger, where strange things happen
						and dark forces lurk. Sex is used to explore themes of desire, power
						dynamics and morality in a way that is both subtle and powerful. And
						finally, the absence of Laura serves as an impetus for much of the
						action in Twin Peaks; her disappearance drives many characters to search
						for answers, while also providing an emotional core for viewers to
						connect with.</p>

					<img src="assets/images/laura-2.png" alt="thesis-1" width="100%" />

					<p style="color:#4b2974">The metaphorical masks worn by the characters in the <em>Twin
							Peaks</em> series and <em>Fire Walk With Me</em><a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref"
							id="fnref85" role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a>
						movie are a powerful symbol of the duality of human nature. On one hand,
						they represent the public persona that each character presents to the
						world, while on the other hand, they also represent their innermost
						secrets and desires. The masks serve as a reminder that beneath our
						outward appearances lies something far more complex and mysterious, the
						shades of our character. I think how bigger the contrast, the more
						interesting it gets.</p>
					<p style="color:#4b2974">John Berger and John Christie both have an appreciation of blue,
						which they describe as simultaneously sad and forward. Berger expresses
						his admiration for the color, noting that it is the most expensive of
						colors and an intimate prize that cannot be judged by any other color.<a href="#fn86"
							class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a> In his words:
						<em>“Blue is memory.
							Blue is nostalgia. But blue is also affrontary and impudence. And this
							is what I love about the color. Blue says outrageously and absurdly I am
							yours, for you are mine, and no other color can judge us.”</em><a href="#fn87"
							class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87" role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
					<p style="color:#4b2974">Blue is incredibly powerful and meaningful in the movie <em>Fire Walk
							With Me</em>. It is used to represent a blue rose, which serves as a
						clue to solve the murder of Teresa Banks. Throughout the film blue
						symbolizes Laura's sadness and confusion as she grapples with her pain
						and searches for self-discovery. Bob is a manifestation of Leland's
						(Laura's father) darker side; while Leland appears to be a loving father
						on the surface, Bob reveals his jealous desire for his own daughter. The
						scene where Laura realizes that Bob is her own father is particularly
						poignant; it's contrasting to how we often hide our darkest sides from
						those we love to protect them from disappointment.</p>
					<p style="color:#4b2974">In the final scene, Laura stands in a pool of blue light and finally
						feels some warmth while an angel reproaches her after having been killed
						by Bob - here blue represents goodness. This moment reminded me that
						although we may not always understand why certain things happen, we can
						still find strength within ourselves to move forward and have control
						over who we want to be from here on out - eventually there will be
						peace. It made me think about how people are assigned responsibility for
						loving us but if they don't fulfill this role then safety takes on
						different meanings; this explains why Laura could do certain things or
						dress certain ways that her innocent friend Donna couldn't do without
						having any emotional connection to it.</p>
					<p style="color:#4b2974">Before my father committed suicide, he delivered a laptop with open
						tabs of controversial pornography to my house along with a list of all
						the women he had cheated on my mom with and an apology note saying:
						<em>“This was it, I’m sorry”.</em> This was the first time I saw his
						dark side being visually represented, which gave me some comfort - just
						like when I watched Bob in the film. Because I believe there can be no
						light without darkness, this thesis aims to show that these shades are
						neither good nor bad but should all be represented in some shape or form
						if you strive to make an honest and maskless portrait of anything.
						Whether this is indigo and it’s shades, facades, denim, Amsterdam or a
						traumatic experience.

					<p style="color: #182a50">In writing this thesis, I was motivated by my personal experiences
						and how they shaped my view of the world. Besides having done two
						internships at sustainable fashion brands and a wish to continue to work
						in this direction, I also have a more personal urgency. Growing up in a
						difficult situation, where my background was the opposite of what I
						wanted to represent, I learned the importance of appearance and how it
						can impact one's perception and success in life. I found comfort in
						creating an alter ego.</p>
					<p style="color: #182a50">Through this experience, I realized that fashion can serve as armor
						to survive the reality of everyday life and can be used to control one's
						image. I believe that by understanding and recognizing these tactics and
						by looking for a match in shades, we can create deeper bonds and better
						understand each other. We should stop seeing every action or outfit as
						mostly a political statement, but rather as an honestly produced
						survival tactic.</p>
					<p style="color: #182a50">Fashion should not be a form of imprisonment, but rather a form of
						escapism<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88" role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a>,
						where one can express themselves
						and their individuality. Just as Jean-Paul Sartre believed that in life,
						a person draws their own portrait and reality is what counts<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref"
							id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a>, I believe that we have the power
						to design ourselves and our work, and have control over the complete
						image. But to achieve this, we have to be brutally honest to ourselves
						about the shades we are made of and the gradient we embody.</p>
