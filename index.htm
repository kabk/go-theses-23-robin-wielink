						This thesis explores how Amsterdam became a leading denim capital and looks at the colour
						indigo,
						from commercial applications to independent expression with artistic analysis and psychological
						and
						philosophical perspectives. It is also a metaphorical quest on the shades that we wear as a mask
						to
						present ourselves to the world - do we show our true colours, or do we conceal us behind a
						facade?
						What shade do you put forward and when? What does your gradient consist of? Michael Taussig's
						work
						(What Color Is the Sacred?) suggests that color can signify authenticity or character and we can
						see
						it as something alive. </p>

					<p style="color:#aac2fa;">From personal experience, I have learned that the way we present ourselves
						can be a powerful tool in
						navigating difficult situations. Simon O'Sullivan's concept of affect as a transhuman aesthetic
						furthers this idea by suggesting that our matter resonates with the matter around us and allows
						us
						to connect with the world. Jean-Paul Sartre's quote "In life man commits himself and draws his
						own
						portrait, outside of which there is nothing" emphasizes how important it is for us to take
						control
						over our lives and create our own destiny. As an artist, I believe these ideas are essential in
						understanding how we can use fashion and aesthetics as a means of self-expression and
						empowerment.</p>

					<p style="color:#aac2fa;">#aac2fa, #4176e1, #8672ef, #9d43f1, #7c33cf, #4d2891, #4b2974, #182a50,
						#0a162e are all hex codes of
						shades of indigo that have been used in the dyeing of clothing around the world. I want to
						emphasize
						that I am using these shades of indigo and denim as metaphorical representations on the
						intensity of
						observation and being, not as literal interpretations and uses of their hues. These shades
						embody
						something becoming deeper and more intense each step and can be seen as a journey. In my
						afterword,
						I will discuss how my thesis came into being and my motivation.

					<p style="color: #4176e1;font-size:1.2rem;"><b>#4176e1</b>

					<p style="color: #4176e1;"> Amsterdam is known for being a hub for the denim industry, with a high
						concentration of denim offices and stores in the city. It is estimated that the denim cluster in
						Amsterdam is worth €500 million, and Amsterdam is considered one of the leading denim capitals
						in the world, alongside Los Angeles and Tokyo. Amsterdam has set a trend in the denim industry
						by promoting sustainability, collaboration, and education. The city is home to a number of
						well-known denim labels, such as G-Star, Levi's, and Denham the Jeanmaker. This growth in the
						denim industry can be attributed to the favourable Dutch tax system, a high number of art
						academies, and the "down-to-earth" mentality of the Dutch, which is reflected in their casual
						style. </p>

					<p style="color: #4176e1;"> Adriano Goldschmied, the co-founder of the Italian denim label Diesel,
						explains the special
						connection between the Netherlands and denim, calling Amsterdam a "global village" that attracts
						international professionals from all over the world. The Netherlands is a jeans-savvy country,
						with 20 million pairs of jeans sold each year, but the production process for denim is
						environmentally harmful and requires a large amount of water. To address these concerns, a
						number of Amsterdam-based brands have signed an agreement known as A Denim Deal, committing to
						using a minimum of 5% recycled content in every pair of jeans and creating at least one million
						jeans with 20% post-consumer recycled content.</p>

					<p style="color: #4176e1;"> Amsterdam's love affair with denim has been acknowledged, but the
						industry has faced criticism
						for its polluting and unfair production processes. To address these issues, stakeholders in the
						Amsterdam denim scene are working to make circular denim a mainstream product and the city is
						aiming to be fully circular by 2050. Junior environment minister Stientje van Veldhoven spoke at
						a press conference, acknowledging the difficulties faced by fashion firms in making changes but
						expressing her hope that the Denim Deal would become a worldwide initiative soon.</p>

					<p style="color: #8672ef; font-size:1.2rem;"><b>#8672ef</b>

					<p style="color: #8672ef;"> I want to discuss two Amsterdam-based designers that have an interesting
						take on denim, as well
						as the work of an Amsterdam-based fashion photographer that uses natural pigments in his work.

						Koen Tossijn was, at first, solely focused on bespoke denim with his label Atelier Tossijn, but
						he always had ambitions to create a full wardrobe of staple pieces. Recently, Koen has been on a
						quest to find a way to make his work stand out, while still working within the modern-day
						fashion industry. He created an alternative for the high tempo of production, information and
						stress that is so common today and in the fashion scene.</p>

					<p style="color: #8672ef;"> Koen's ‘Wardrobe’ collection consists of four immaculate pieces made
						from only the best
						materials available. His denim is created in-house with a single thread machine and
						hand-stitching details out of 10 oz yarn indigo-dyed selvage twill fabric made of US cotton and
						woven at the Kuroki mill in Japan. The industrial jacket that he makes is also created in-house
						with a single thread machine and hand-stitching details out of the same fabric. The sweater in
						his collection is made from dark, nearly black, blue merino wool from Loro Piana knitted in
						Italy, while the flat hat is constructed from dark, nearly black, blue wool cashmere and is made
						in England with James Lock & Co.</p>

					<p style="color: #8672ef;"> Koen's view on fashion is one that focuses on quality over quantity; he
						believes that by
						bringing things back to their most essential form we can create more time and space for
						ourselves as well as offer an alternative for those who want something different than what
						traditional fashion offers them. This reminds me of the vision of Bonne Suits, where I conducted
						an internship. Koen hopes that his Wardrobe collection will be seen as an example for how
						fashion can be done differently - without sacrificing quality or style - while still creating
						something timelessly beautiful that people can enjoy wearing for years to come.</p>

					<p style="color: #8672ef;">Mick Keus is the founder of his studio MICKKEUS. Mick’s original take on
						denim is a unique blend
						of vintage and modern. His designs are inspired by the classic Levi’s 501 jeans, with a
						contemporary twist. He uses high-quality materials to create custom-made pieces that are both
						stylish and durable. The process begins with Mick selecting the perfect pair of jeans. He then
						customizes these by cutting and sewing the fabric where it should be adjusted, adding details
						such as pockets, rivets, buttons and zippers to complete the look. Finally, he applies a special
						indigo wash technique to give each pair of jeans its own unique character.</p>

					<p style="color: #8672ef;">In an interview with Metro, Mick expressed his preference for the older
						fabrics of the 501s,
						saying that they "represent the real rock-n-roll style and age beautifully." After recognizing
						that others appreciated his work, Keus established his own label in 2012. Customers can make an
						appointment to visit his store and try on his tailor-made 501’s. His designs are highly sought
						after.</p>

					<p style="color: #8672ef;"> Keus' approach to sustainability is not something he consciously strives
						for; however, by using
						secondhand materials, he is still being sustainable without having to boast about it. He
						believes that by creating one-of-a-kind pieces from preloved materials, customers can enjoy a
						unique look while also reducing their environmental impact. Furthermore, Keus has stated in an
						interview with One World that aesthetics are more important than sustainability to him. However,
						this does not mean that sustainability should be overlooked or disregarded entirely. Instead, it
						should be seen as a bonus when considering the purchase of one of Keus' creations - a bonus
						which allows customers to enjoy both fashion and sustainability simultaneously. I think he has
						such a refreshing approach to this topic!</p>

					<p style="color: #8672ef;"> Fashion photographer Rijn Kooyman's use of natural pigments in his work
						is a testament to his
						deep-rooted fascination for nature and the power of stillness. I see a relation here with the
						calming power of blue, which is a colour he also uses often(Bring in something from gage). He
						uses natural minerals, clay, herbal powders, fine crushed stones, Arabic gum and water from the
						Veneon river in the South of France to paint giant boulders. This process takes between 6 to 10
						hours and has been painted during various seasons.</p>

					<p style="color: #8672ef;">Kooyman believes that every color he uses is a symbol of a specific
						period in his life; as the
						colors fade with time—so does the moment. He is an expert of creating systems that produce
						natural shades. He sees this process as profoundly peaceful and allows him time to reflect on
						his unconditional love for nature and city life. Through this project, Kooyman hopes to remind
						people to consciously practice the art of being in the moment.</p>

					<p style="color: #8672ef;">The painting sessions are often done alone, allowing Kooyman time for
						self-reflection and
						contemplation while creating something beautiful out of nature’s materials. The rocks turn back
						to their natural states over time; reminding us that everything passes eventually, including our
						own lives, and we should make sure we appreciate each moment while it lasts.</p>

					<p style="color:#9d43f1; font-size:1.2rem;"><B>#9d43f1</B></p>

					<p style="color:#9d43f1;"> Electric Dub Station (Orbital Ignition) is a collaboration between artist
						Antonio Jose Guzman
						and artist and textile designer Iva Jankovic, which explores
						the history of slave trade and indigo through artistic practice. The installation consists of
						performers wearing traditional clothing from Surinamese and Javanese plantations, accompanied by
						an audio-visual performance featuring dub music. It is intended to evoke the memory of those who
						were enslaved in the production of indigo, while also highlighting indigo’s importance in
						contemporary culture.</p>

					<p style="color:#9d43f1;">Through this work, Guzman and Jankovic aim to create a space for
						reflection on our shared
						history and its implications for today's society. It serves as an invitation to explore the past
						through art, music and movement. It is an opportunity to reflect on how our present is shaped by
						our collective histories, while also providing a platform for dialogue about how we can move
						forward together in creating a better future. By bringing together elements from different
						cultures and contexts, Guzman and Jankovic create a powerful visual representation of the
						transatlantic slave trade that speaks to contemporary audiences. Their work has recently been
						added to the collection of the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. Through their work they hope to
						inspire viewers to think critically about their own relationship with history, identity and
						power dynamics in order to create meaningful change in their communities. I think it serves as a
						great message for today’s (fashion) designers and artists.</p>

					<p style="color:#9d43f1;">The artwork Jallianwala: Repression and Retribution by the British artist
						group Singh Twins,
						explores stories around the dye extracted from the leaves of the indigo plant. Indigo dye and
						textiles became highly desired across the globe, from the Far East and Africa to Europe, North
						America and the West Indies. Determined to have control of the market, knowledge about how to
						cultivate indigo was eagerly sought by European traders. This artwork depicts the 17th-century
						Indian queen, Mumtaz Mahal, wife of Emperor Shah Jahan (depicted in her pendant) who placed the
						monopoly on the trade of indigo. She wears blue denim jeans commonly associated with modern
						western fashion and values. She thereby presents a challenge to this perception regarding the
						cultural ownership of denim fabric, she says the true origins of which go back to 16th century
						India, in the port town of Dongri where this tough fabric was used for sails and ‘dungri’ (later
						‘dungarees’) worn by sailors.</p>

					<p style="color:#9d43f1;">Through wearing many jewels, Mumtaz additionally represents the fact that
						Indigo dye was once
						rare and very expensive, a luxury commodity associated with royalty, political power and
						authority. Otherwise known as the ‘blue gold’ , Indigo iwas so valuable that, when prices were
						high, it was used as currency to purchase slaves, who were worth their own weight in indigo.
						During the 16th and 17th centuries, England and Europe passed laws banning the trade and use of
						Indian Indigo, which threatened to replace their home-grown blue dye (woad) industry. In the
						West, people were scared of the colour, because they believed it had mystical powers. To
						discourage its popularity, it was officially condemned as “the false and pernicious Indian
						drug”, “poisonous”, “deceitful and injurious”, “the devil’s blue” and “food for the devil”!
						Pictured bottom right is the Portuguese explorer, Vasco Da Gama (1460-1524) who is credited as
						the first European to discover the sea route to India in 1498, although, he was actually guided
						there, the artist claims, from Malindi on the West coast of Africa, by an Indian navigator from
						Gujarat. Nevertheless, this event is hugely significant to the story of indigo, because it
						enabled European merchants to trade directly with India rather than relying on middlemen in the
						traditional marts of the Levant (Eastern Mediterranean region).</p>

					<p style="color:#7c33cf; font-size:1.2rem;"><B>#7c33cf</B></p>

					<p style="color:#7c33cf" ;> In Herman Peij's book, “van Karmijn, Purper & Blauw over kleuren van de
						Middeleeuwen en daarna”, he
						talks about how blue is used to represent a wide range of negative qualities in the Middle Ages
						and
						after. Here I want to connect the shades and facades I described in my foreword. The negative
						connotations to the colour must be related to the equally extreme positive points that the color
						offers. With this, I mean the sacred, calming and holy powers discussed at the end of this
						thesis.</p>

					<p style="color:#7c33cf" ;>The more heavenly and timeless the associations with blue are, the
						sharper must also be the earthly
						opposites. If blue from heaven builds a bridge between earth and hereafter, then Mary, the
						mediator
						between sinful man and God, is always clothed in a blue mantle, with loyalty as its keyword. But
						the
						earthly opposite of blue is then the fleeting world of appearance, deception and hypocrisy. This
						finds its expression in an incredible number of expressions, sayings and phenomena that still
						live
						on today for a large part.</p>

					<p style="color:#7c33cf" ;>In the Middle Ages, blue became the color of mundane things in life that
						had no place in everyday
						life. Peij describes examples such as drunken nobility, corrupt monks, lustful nuns, rich sons
						wasting money on gambling, willing housewives, disabled people and other ‘unproductive members
						of
						society’. ‘Blue beguines’ were prostitutes (Blauwe Bet for instance was a prostitute from Arnhem
						in
						1455), blue devotion was quasi-piety; blue glosses, arguments or sermons were not accepted, a
						man
						who had been cheated on by his wife would be given a blue cloak and a swindler's income would be
						collected in a "blue pocket" (aftroggelzak).</p>

					<p style="color:#7c33cf" ;>These are just examples of the countless applications that still exist
						today in expressions such as
						"a blue Monday", "getting the blues" or "een blauwtje lopen". It is curious to see how
						inventively,
						if not literarily, these attractive uses are continued. Now we get sayings like "living in the
						blue
						bellows", meaning settling somewhere where one wishes to remain completely unknown. There is, I
						think, a lot of pain involved in having “blue balls” and the disqualification "blue-faced" or
						"blue
						shooter" used to be an attractive insult for an impotent or failing lover who can no longer meet
						the
						stereotypical eagerness of a woman. It is interesting to think that once upon a time it was said
						in
						Holland that indigo, due to its magical powers and ability to change color when exposed to air,
						could make men infertile. I did not know this was also said about blue itself from the Middle
						Ages
						on, until I read Peij's book.</p>

					<p style="color:#4d2891; font-size:1.2rem;"><B>#4d2891</B></p>

					<p style="color:#4d2891"> In the book "I Send You This Cadmium Red", John Berger and John Christie
						share a 15-year dialogue
						about art, color, life, and the creative process. Through their intimate letters exchanged
						between
						1977 to 1992, readers gain a look into the two men's understanding of art, as well as their
						personal
						reflections on the world around them. But most importantly, the book offers a unique perspective
						on
						how different colors can have symbolic meaning while also exploring the challenges of being an
						artist.</p>

					<p style="color:#4d2891">The parts from the book that I find particularly captivating are their
						exploration of color. They
						say that color has the power to evoke emotion, memory, and nostalgia. It can be a source of
						comfort
						or a reminder of something lost. In these passages, Berger and Christie explore the nuances of
						color
						in a way that is both poetic and profound.</p>

					<p style="color:#4d2891">They start with blackness, which is described as “not with the color black,
						but with the mystery,
						the invitation of black blackness as in a black coat, as in black hair”. This description paints
						an
						image of something dark yet inviting; something that holds secrets within its depths, like the
						mask
						I have been discussing. I think it's interesting that the writer is talking about three
						seemingly unrelated topics - the
						color black, sex and the forest - and they also say that a personal called Bieca's absence is
						still
						present. This way of looking at these topics reminded me of how precisely these topics were
						treated
						in Lynch’s Twin Peaks.</p>

					<p style="color:#4d2891">The colour black, the forest, sex and a missing girl are all integral
						elements of the series. The
						colour black is used to represent the darkness that lurks beneath the surface of this small
						town, as
						well as to symbolize death and mystery. The forest is a place of secrets and danger, where
						strange
						things happen and dark forces lurk. Sex is used to explore themes of desire, power dynamics, and
						morality in a way that is both subtle and powerful. And finally, the absence of Laura serves as
						an
						impetus for much of the action in Twin Peaks; her disappearance drives many characters to search
						for
						answers while also providing an emotional core for viewers to connect with.</p>

					<p style="color:#4d2891">The metaphorical masks worn by the characters in the series Twin Peaks are
						a powerful symbol of the
						duality of human nature. On one hand, they represent the public persona that each character
						presents
						to the world, while on the other hand, they also represent their innermost secrets and desires.
						The
						masks serve as a reminder that beneath our outward appearances lies something far more complex
						and
						mysterious, the shades of our character. I think how bigger the contrast, the more interesting
						it
						gets.</p>

					<p style="color:#4d2891">The color blue is incredibly powerful and meaningful in David Lynch's movie
						Fire Walk With Me, which
						was a pilot for the series. It is used to represent the inner feelings of protagonist Laura
						Palmer,
						as well as her journey towards self-discovery. Throughout the film, blue symbolizes Laura's
						sadness
						and confusion as she tries to understand all that has happened to her. The color also serves as
						a
						reminder of the pain she has endured and how it has shaped her into who she is today. In one
						particularly scene, Laura stands in a pool of blue light while reflecting on her past
						experiences. I
						felt like this moment reminded that although we may not always understand why certain things
						happen,
						we can still find strength within ourselves to move forward and have control of who we want to
						be
						from here.</p>

					<p style="color:#4d2891">John Berger and John Christie both have an appreciation of blue, which they
						describe as
						simultaneously sad and forward. Berger expresses his admiration for the color, noting that it is
						the
						most expensive of colors and an intimate prize that cannot be judged by any other color. In his
						words: “Blue is memory. Blue is nostalgia. But blue is also affrontary and impudence. And this
						is
						what I love about the color. Blue says outrageously and absurdly I am yours, for you are mine,
						and
						no other color can judge us.”</p>

					<p style="color:#4d2891"> A movement that certainly showed their true colours and were also in
						control of the design of their
						own masks were the Provo’s in Amsterdam. This movement was a major force in the city's cultural
						and
						political landscape, and its legacy can be seen in the city's vibrant art scene, progressive
						politics, and open-minded attitude. Provo's 'ludiek' activism was particularly influential;
						their
						creative protests and stunts were designed to draw attention to social issues such as poverty,
						pollution, police brutality, and censorship.</p>

					<p style="color:#4d2891"> These tactics were adopted by other activist groups in Amsterdam and
						beyond, inspiring generations
						of activists to come. Provo also had a lasting impact on fashion: their iconic
						anti-materialistic
						old jeans became a symbol of rebellion for many young people in the Netherlands. To this day,
						denim
						remains popular among Dutch youth as a way to express their individuality and independence. This
						so-claimed “Free Spirit Of Amsterdam” has insipired it’s fashion designers since, with some
						brands
						(Scotch & Soda) even using it in their taglines.</p>

					<p style="color:#4b2974; font-size:1.2rem;"><B>#4b2974</B></p>

					<p style="color:#4b2974;">The history of indigo is problematic and complex, because the colour
						has had such a big impact on many cultures around the world. As mentioned before in my
						analysis of Jallianwala: Repression and Retribution, one of the most significant periods in
						the history of indigo is its relationship to slave trade, where the Dutch and the City of
						Amsterdam took a great part in. Indigo has been used as a dye for clothing and other
						textiles for thousands of years. The earliest known use of indigo dye was in Peru, but it
						became more well-known from ancient Egypt on, where it was used to color the cloth used on
						mummies. In the centuries that followed, indigo was used by many other cultures, including
						the ancient Greeks and Romans.</p>

					<p style="color:#4b2974;">With the start of the slave trade, indigo began to have a major impact on
						world history.
						Europeans set up large plantations in the Americas where indigo was grown and harvested by
						African slaves. The first clothing dyed with indigo was "Negro cloth", which were uniforms
						worn by these enslaved people. Voltaire noted in 1756 that hundreds of thousands of Black
						and mulatto slaves were working in sugar mills, indigo and cocoa plantations, sacrificing
						their lives to satisfy Europeans' newfound desires for sugar, cocoa, coffee and tobacco.</p>

					<p style="color:#4b2974;">The city of Amsterdam played an important role in the trade as one of
						leading centers for
						Dutch slave traders who transported slaves from Africa to America, as well as merchants
						dealing with the sale of indigo and other goods produced on the plantations. Amsterdam
						traded with many parts around world contributing significantly towards the global economy at
						that time period, but also had devastating consequences for millions of enslaved people who
						were forced into inhuman conditions under this system</p>

					<p style="color:#4b2974;">The Dutch were not the only Europeans involved in the slave trade and the
						production of
						indigo. The British and the French also played significant roles in this trade, as did many
						other European powers. However, the Dutch were among the most significant players in this
						trade, with Amsterdam being one of the leading centers of this commerce.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<p style="color: #182a50; font-size:1.2rem;"><B>#182a50</B></p>

					<p style="color:#182a50;"> Indigo has been a timeless symbol of wisdom, self-mastery, and spiritual
						realization for centuries. In literature and art, the color has been used to represent a range
						of themes from transformation to power. In Marina Warner’s Indigo, the transformation of Sycorax
						(Shakespeare's dark witch) into an indigo creature through indigo dye is a powerful metaphor for
						her spiritual elevation and mastery of self. It suggests that with enough determination and
						effort, one can reach a higher level of understanding and enlightenment.</p>

					<p style="color:#182a50;">Similarly, in the movie Prospero's Books, the water and its indigo hue
						represent postmodern
						narrative techniques as well as political power, communication through books, stages and films,
						words and images, iconic and symbolic signs. Indigo is used to illustrate how Prospero's
						knowledge is both powerful yet fragile; it can be used to manipulate or enlighten those around
						him but it can also be taken away if he fails to use it wisely. The use of indigo in this film
						serves as a reminder that knowledge should be respected but also wielded carefully in order to
						achieve true wisdom.</p>

					<p style="color:#182a50;">John Gage's seminal work Color and Culture: Practice and Meaning from
						Antiquity to Abstraction
						begins by examining the ancient Egyptians' utilization of blue in their art and architecture,
						noting that it was seen as a symbol of life, fertility, and rebirth due to its association with
						the Nile River. He then delves into the use of blue in decorative art such as Islamic tilework,
						ceramics, and textiles during the Middle Ages; where it was associated with royalty due to its
						frequent use in tombs and temples dedicated to gods or pharaohs.</p>

					<p style="color:#182a50;">Gage further investigates how perfecting techniques for making pigments
						such as cobalt or
						ultramarine impacted Renaissance art. He also examines how Yves Klein and Yves Tanguy used blue
						to evoke strong emotions in viewers within modern art movements such as Stijl, which was heavily
						influenced by Neoplasticism - a movement which sought to create a universal visual language
						through simple geometric forms combined with primary colors. One of these colors being blue,
						which is often used to represent harmony and balance in this context.</p>

					<p style="color:#182a50;">Blue is seen as a symbol of spiritual purity, truth, infinity, order
						amidst chaos - all
						qualities of which I think are essential for any artist. Michael Taussig's book What Colour is
						the Sacred? provides an insightful analysis into the cultural significance of blue throughout
						history; from religious ceremonies such as Christianity, where it is often used in liturgical
						vestments. Or Hinduism, where it is associated with Krishna. He also discusses right up until
						modern times where it can be seen as a unifying force between different cultures or religions -
						an idea that resonates deeply within me, as I think that acknowledging these shades can create
						true connection.</p>

					<p style="color:#182a50;">As I gazed upon the same subject from seven different angles, I have been
						able to gain a greater
						understanding of myself and the topics at hand. But I also hope that you, as a reader, can take
						this concept and apply it to your own life. Consider what your shield is made of; what colors
						make up your gradient? Then, find or create something that will represent this shield. Whether
						it be through buying something new, re-purposing an old item, redesigning something you already
						have or searching for a second-hand piece - find something that speaks to you and reflects who
						you are, or, design how you can conceal it.</p>

					<p style="color:#182a50;">If one of the most “sacred” aims that man can set for himself is to
						acquire as exact and intense
						an understanding of himself as possible, it seems desirable that each one, scrutinizing his
						memories with the greatest possible honesty, examine whether he can discover there some sign
						permitting him to discern the color for him of the very notion of the sacred. (Michel Leiris,
						The Sacred in Everyday Life)</p>

					<p style="color:#0a162e;"> In writing this thesis, I was motivated by my personal experiences and
						how they shaped my view of the world. Growing up in a difficult situation, where my background
						was the opposite (a combination of abuse, criminality and homelessness) of what I wanted to
						represent, I learned the importance of appearance and how it can impact one's perception and
						success in life. I found comfort in creating an alter ego.</p>

						<p style="color:#0a162e;">Through this experience, I realized that fashion can serve as armor to survive the reality of
						everyday life and can be used to control one's image. I believe that by understanding and
						recognizing these tactics look for a match in shades, we can create deeper bonds and better
						understand each other. We should stop seeing every action or outfit as a political statement,
						but rather as an honestly produced survival tactic.</p>

						<p style="color:#0a162e;">Fashion should not be a form of imprisonment, but rather a form of escapism, where one can
						express themselves and their individuality. Just as Jean-Paul Sartre believed that in life, a
						person draws their own portrait and reality is what counts, I believe that we have the power to
						design ourselves and our work, and to control the image we present to the world. But to achieve
						this, we have to be brutally honest to ourselves about the shades we are made of and the
						gradient we embody.</p>
